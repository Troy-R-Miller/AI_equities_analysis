**The data collected and equities showcased in this project are intended to be educational. The following is strongly opinionated is not to be used as investment advice.**

AI is on the rise and has been a hot topic of conversation in every industry. The use of AI has increased productivity, streamlined processing and allows professionals to optimize their workflows. This project aims to showcase the parabolic growth of AI equities in the stock market and highlight a handful of top performers. 

To celebrate the rise of AI and to showcase its abilities, I utilized AI to assist with data collection for this project. By using carefully curated prompts, AI was able to identify 15 top performing equities in the market, which I have narrowed down to the Top 5 as it relates to market cap. Per the chart above, Palantir Technologies has seen incredible growth from 52 week lows. 

Their growth can be attributed to a substantial increase in revenue from 2024, seeing an increase of 48% y-o-y, along with the adoption of thei AI platform by several industries. While Palantir's growth is significant, and is rightfully ranked at the top of our list for growth in 2025, the current market leader NVIDIA, paves the path for an AI future while boasting a market cap exceeding 4 Trillion USD. 

Given the massive market cap, NVIDIA continues to see growth and shows no signs of slowing down. In 2024, the corporation issued a 10-1 stock split, while once trading in excess of $1000, the stock is now trading at $164 as of 09/09/2025. 

What can we learn from this data? AI is still very new, and is still considered an emerging market. Opportunity is plentiful and market enthusiasts, such as myself, have a chance to join the movement while it's young.
